    "hook": "The Republican Reconciliation Bill isn’t just a budget — it’s a political weapon targeting working families to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy.",
    "key_facts": [
      "The bill passed the House by a single vote and contains over 1,000 pages of sweeping reforms.",
      "It slashes funding for public education, housing assistance, and food security programs like SNAP.",
      "It delivers trillions in tax breaks, primarily benefiting corporations and the top 1%.",
      "It repeals climate investments and healthcare subsidies passed under the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates it would increase inequality and reduce economic mobility."

    "what_to_highlight": [
      "This isn’t just about budgets — it’s about values.",
      "Point out who benefits (billionaires) and who suffers (working families).",
      "Emphasize the real-life impacts: rent hikes, school closures, food insecurity."

    "suggested_post": "The Republican “Reconciliation Bill” is a cruel con. It guts housing, education, and food aid – all to give billionaires another tax cut. We can’t let them get away with it.",

    "title": "DOGE Failed",
    "hook": "Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) promised to cut waste and save taxpayers trillions. Instead, it failed to deliver real savings—while expanding surveillance, triggering chaos, and making government bigger and more dangerous.",
    "key_facts": [
      "Musk promised $2 trillion in savings. Verifiable savings? Just $5 billion—only 0.25% of what was promised.",
      "DOGE's most publicized cuts were mostly one-time actions like canceled leases, not structural reforms.",
      "While DOGE claimed $165 billion in savings, receipts exist for only $70 billion—most unverifiable.",
      "Independent watchdog *Musk Watch* estimates the real savings at just $5.02 billion.",
      "DOGE may ultimately cost taxpayers $135 billion due to lawsuits, inefficiencies, and lost tax revenue."
    ],
    "what_to_highlight": [
      "Despite the name, DOGE made the government less efficient and more chaotic.",
      "The agency caused mass layoffs at critical institutions—like the FAA and National Nuclear Security Administration—endangering lives.",
      "DOGE consolidated federal data into a centralized surveillance database spanning the IRS, DHS, and voter rolls.",
      "While claiming to fight waste, DOGE gutted tax enforcement—potentially losing the U.S. $2.4 trillion in future revenue."
    ],
    "suggested_post": "DOGE didn’t cut waste. It cut public health, nuclear security, and civil liberties. Elon Musk’s “efficiency” scam cost us jobs, safety, and trust—with almost no real savings.",
